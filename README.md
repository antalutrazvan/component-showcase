# component-showcase
A small learning project, to be able to bridge any gaps I have in creating basic frontend components.

## structure
 **vanilla** and **react** folders with **components**, **pages** and **utils** folders each

 Basic as hell, just want to create some frontend components with vanilla code, and then create their ReactJS counterparts.
 No state management no nothing. That might come after.

 Using webpack 3, react-16.

 TODO:

 -- define loaders and further config for webpack (style, font, file)
 -- add React 1.6
 -- add dev-server and hot-reloading
 -- add htmlPluging to externalize dist folder
 -- add dist to gitignore
 -- start developing components
